# Sylvia's Readme 

#### What is this?
I am told to prepare my Manager README, but I didn’t want it to be a document about my management style or expectations. Instead, I thought it might be more appropriate as a user guide for people who would like to work with me and some of the principles I work by. 

#### My Principles of Work
- **I do what I do because of a desire for excellence.** I strive to do the best work possible, not out of obligations or checking off items. My deliverables are the outcome of my work, not outputs. The movement or process of doing the work does not matter as much if the end product is not good.
- **Bullshit-free environment.** As a manager / leader, I aim to create a bullshit-free environment where people love what they do and who they do it with. 
- **Face-to-face interaction is my preferred form of communication.** It allows me to use all my senses for observing an interaction. With a deeper understanding of the situation, I can ground my actions in reality to achieve a more desirable direction.
- **My time is my own to manage.** I tend to set my own priorities. And if I am not being productive, there is not much value in sitting in the office just to be there. I have no problems with working remotely or outside of working hours if that is the best way to get the work done. 
- **My head is in the game even if my butt is not in the chair.** A large part of my work is thinking and being with the individuals / teams. If I am not at my desk, I am likely in the office somewhere facilitating a workshop or having a conversation. Even if I am not in the office, I am turning over the system in my head, making recommendations, designing experiments or documenting processes. Sometimes, I prefer some alone time free from distractions.
- **Run small experiments, and examine the results.** Small changes support learning. Big changes feel like existential threats. I tend to avoid or mitigate risks as much as I can. 
- **It is better to get results than to be right.** If I disagree with you, I may argue for my preferred solution or bring up different viewpoints. But as a coach, most of the time, I will leave it to you to make the decision, even if I do not think it is the best path forward. Unless I see a huge disaster in the making, I am comfortable raising my objections and then letting the work proceed.
- **Get up and talk to people.** Do not wait for the conversation to come to you.
- **It is a question of striking the right balance.** 

#### About me
I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering, diploma in Biomedical Informatics and Engineering. I am in the robotics team during secondary school. I am surrounded by code for the largest part of my life. But I have never coded professionally at work. I worked in the last decade as a business analyst, project, program, product manager as such. I used to wonder why I didn’t spend my first couple of years as a developer. I do not regret though. 

Outside of work, I have many interests like scuba-diving, snowboarding, trekking, rock climbing and many other neglected outdoor pursuits. Talk to me if you are up for any adventures. Or if you want to strike up a casual conversation and don’t know where to start, ask me what I do for fun.

#### My job
In Sep 2018, I joined SPD as an agile specialist. I aim to help individuals and teams strive to do the best work possible in today's VUCA world. I use agile methods that can cross many divisions to guide agile teams to deliver value continuously. Talk to me about your quest for agility, or if you want to bounce ideas, all is fine. 

#### My profile
I have taken random personality tests and assessments and am “classified” as below. Read it with a pinch of salt.

#### If you want to set time with me
- **My calendar is open** – This is by design. You can see who I meet, about what (agenda) and for how long. If I need time for myself, I will capture on my calendar as “do not disturb”.
- **If you need me** – Simply ask in Slack (if not urgent for the next few hours) or face-to-face (if it is urgent). I am pretty good with context switches. I am here to serve. I am here to help you succeed. It is my job. Please do not assume I am too busy. 
- **If I’m working from home** – Please expect me to be as available as I would be as if I was in the office. Do not hesitate to call me if you think chatting face-to-face or screen-sharing will be more useful than textual communication. We can schedule a zoom meeting or video/voice call even if it is 5 minutes or less.

#### My availability
- **Email**: I read and reply to emails at least once a day. (Occurrence drop because of ISS)
- **Slack**: I check this quite often. For direct mention, I usually reply within a few hours. It is usually much faster if I am not in a meeting.
- **Telegram (personal)**: During working hours, I do not check Telegram as often compared to Slack. If I am on holiday or after working hours, this might be a better channel. I try to reply within 30mins, but it may take up to a few hours, as I am likely doing some activity.
- **Phone call**: Please use this for urgent cases. Usually, I will answer or reply asap.
