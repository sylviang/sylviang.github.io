If you’re curious or ’d like to learn more about agile development, can look at the 2 items below.

- [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) (4 Values & 12 Principles, short but meaningful.)
- [The 2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) (Scrum is a common framework that we are currently using. Reduced to about 10 pages now.)
